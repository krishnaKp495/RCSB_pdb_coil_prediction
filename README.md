Protein Coil Structure Detection using Random Forest
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model based on Random Forest to detect the number of coil structures in proteins. The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle and consists of 11,832 protein structures sourced from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). The data includes human proteins determined using X-ray crystallography and covers the period from 2015 to 2023.

The project's primary objective is to classify and predict the number of coil structures in a given protein based on the provided structural features.

Dataset Information
Source: Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samiraalipour/rcsb-pdb-macromolecular-structure-dataset/data)
Number of entries: 11,832 protein structures
Organism: Homo sapiens (human)
Period: 2015 - 2023
Features:
Structural data determined by X-ray crystallography
Key features include atomic coordinates, B-factor, resolution, and secondary structure information such as helices, sheets, and coils.
Model and Approach
The project employs a Random Forest algorithm, a robust and interpretable ensemble learning method suitable for both classification and regression tasks. Random Forest works by constructing multiple decision trees during training and averaging the results to reduce overfitting and improve predictive accuracy.

Steps Followed:
Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Data: Any missing values were handled by appropriate imputation techniques.
Feature Scaling: Applied normalization to features to improve model performance.
Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split.
Model Training:

A Random Forest model was trained using the training set, with hyperparameters such as the number of estimators, maximum depth, and minimum samples split being optimized through Grid Search.
Cross-Validation:

Performed 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model and prevent overfitting.
Performance Metrics:

Evaluated the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
The cross-validated RMSE score was used to assess the modelâ€™s accuracy in predicting the number of coil structures.
